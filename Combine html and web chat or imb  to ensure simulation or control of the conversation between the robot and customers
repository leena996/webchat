 If your in-class notes are messy, unorganized, and unclear at first glance, you’re not going to get much use out of them. This has nothing to do with how neat your handwriting is &mdash; it’s all about how your notes are structured. One of the most effective ways to remember (and understand) what you are learning in class is to take effective notes in the classroom.

</ol>
</li>
